# TOP landing page
This is the landing page project from The Odin Project curriculum. This project is part of the FlexBox subject. The objective here is to use basic HTML and basic CSS with flexbox to create a simple landing page and strength the knowlegde adquired in the course so far. The design interface was given by them and I will keep as it is because my main objective here is to pratice positioning the elements of the page.
